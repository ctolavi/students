# Students solution

To keep it simple the solution has been developed:

- Without any Lib/dependency.
- There is no packages to follow the excecution examples:  **“java StudentSolution input.csv name=Leia”**
- All code that had been considered “unnecessary” for this excercise were removed(Logs, method documentation, tests, etc)
- About the complexity. in order to not over engineer the solution some considerations that should be taken in account were discarted(search for a name using critera like case insensitive for example).
- To develop this exercice as a test the limit of two hours was considered.
